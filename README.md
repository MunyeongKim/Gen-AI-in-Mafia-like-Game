# Gen-AI-in-Mafia-like-Game
This is the repository for codes, scripts and output data of "Generative AI in Mafia-like Game Simulation" by Munyeong Kim and Sungsu Kim (2023).

There are 3 different files in "Data" folder:

1. Ex1. All responses of gpt-3.5-turbo (as GPT-4 haven't shown any errors in our samples) are provided, and we categorized which type of error(s) each response contains by True/False.
It would help you how many and various types of errors are in them, which makes utilizing it difficult.


2. Ex2. Logs of all 8 games.
How to understand these logs is provided in the main text.


3. Codes.
We provided all types of code at once. You can choose how to run the game.
- If you want to run it on GPT-4 API, run the codes and you will be available to conduct a game within a few trials.
- If you want to run it by GPT-4 provided by chatGPT, it automatically clips each sequence's script on a clipboard.
- If you literally aren't aware of programming and if you cannot run this file, that's okay. just use those rules, strategies, and scripts and run the games by copy and paste. (but I recommend to learn the logic of the code. there's no more than basic Python on it.)

    "The rules for a game of \"Spyfall\" are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five players in total, each with a number from 1 to 5. One of them is chosen to be the 'spy', and the goal of the remaining players is to find the spy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is played over a total of 10 turns, each turn consisting of\n",
    "1. a player asks another player a question\n",
    "1. the player who was asked the question answers\n",
    "1. after hearing the question and answer, decide if you want to point to a specific player as the spy\n",
    "1.1. vote on whether to hang the player (if someone has been named)\n",
    "1. Decide if the spy will reveal their identity This is done in this order.\n",
    "The first player to ask a question is Player 1, and so on until the player who was asked the question has the opportunity to ask a question on their next turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player has the opportunity to name another player as the \"Spy\" only once during the game. Once a player is named, the rest of the players vote on whether that player should be hung. If the player receives 4 or more votes, they are hung. If the hanged player was a spy, the not-spy players win; otherwise, the spy wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the spy reveals that they are the spy, the spy must guess the location. If the location is correct, the spy wins; if it is incorrect, the spy loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all 10 turns have been played and the spy has not been revealed, all players vote for the player they think is the spy. The player with the most votes is assumed to be the spy, and if this player is indeed the spy, the normal players win, otherwise the spy wins. If there is more than one player with the most votes, the vote is redone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the game progresses, at each turn, players will receive the following requests. (There is nothing players can do to affect the game other than the requests below, so players will need to play with that in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. to the player asking the question (for the first turn, Player 1; thereafter, the player who answered the question on the previous turn):\n",
    "    1. Now it's your turn to ask a question. Choose 1-5 players other than yourself, and write a question.\n",
    "    Please write your response in the form (n_player,\"question\")\n",
    "2. When asking for answers to subsequent questions\n",
    "    1. In the nth question, player P asked you the following. Please write your answer to this question inside the \"\" mark.'\n",
    "3. After all questions and answers have been heard, all players will be asked the following on each turn. Note that players may not interact with each other other other than to name players or not to name players.\n",
    "    1. At this point, do you want to use the opportunity to name a spy? If yes, write the number of the player you want to name, otherwise write an X in your response.Please only write numbers or Xs in your response.\n",
    "4. if a player has named someone else as a player, they will be asked to vote as follows. Note that players cannot interact with each other other other than O and X. 1.\n",
    "    1. 'Subsequently, player P accused player Q of being a spy. Therefore, a vote was held. If you want to hang player Q as a spy, please enter O. If not, please enter X.'\n",
    "5. At this point, if no one has accused another player this turn, or if a vote is held but does not receive a sufficient number of votes, the game continues and the spy reveals his or her identity and decides whether to guess the location as follows.\n",
    "    1. At this point, would you identify yourself as a spy and guess the place?\n",
    "    If you would like to reveal your identity and guess the place, please enter the name of the place. If not, please enter an X. Please only answer with a place name or X.\n",
    "6. If the spy has not revealed his or her identity at this point, you will move on to the next turn and repeat the sequence from 1.\n",
    "7. At the end of turn 10, a vote is taken to finally reveal the spy. Note that requests are received in order, starting with Player 1, and may include a three-sentence statement along with the person to be voted out. This vote is repeated until a particular player receives a majority of the votes.\n",
    "Additional. The location is chosen as one of the following lists (no capitalization)\n",
    "[airplane, amusement park, bank, beach, carnival, casino, circus tent, corporate party, crusader army, day spa, embassy, hospital, hotel, military base, movie studio, nightclub, ocean liner, passenger train, pirate ship, polar station, police station, restaurant, school, service station, space station, submarine, supermarket, theater, university, zoo]\n",
    "'''\n",
    "strategy = '''\n",
    "(Additional) When it comes to strategy and how to play \"Spy Fall,\" the following facts can be helpful.\n",
    "1. players should basically keep their conversations vague so that the spy doesn't notice the location. You can execute this effectively by framing your responses to correspond to at least 4 or 5, and, depending on the level of ambiguity needed, up to 20~30 different locations.\n",
    "2. spies will also try to prove that they are not spies by choosing their questions in this way.\n",
    "3. You'll also want to confuse the spy as much as possible in order to reach your goal before they do. Keep in mind that unlike normal players, spies don't have information about the location. \n",
    "4. In response, the Spy will try to deflect suspicion away from themselves by using phrases that imply specific information about the location, or by pointing to other players to add to the confusion.\n",
    "5. To find the spy through the game, you need to closely observe the questions and answers, as well as the nominations and votes of other players. Observe who is suspecting whom.\n",
    "6. In the game, players have no way to express their opinions other than by asking questions, answering questions, and calling out spies. Therefore, if you suspect a player, you should immediately call them out as a spy. If this is a reasonable suspicion, the other players will agree, and if not, they will disagree. Calling out spies is an important strategy because it is the only way to know what other players are doing.\n",
    "7. Spies should reveal their identity when they have enough information about the location, or when they believe the risk of other players identifying them as a spy is sufficiently great.\n",

    "The rules for a game of \"Spyfall\" are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five players in total, each with a number from 1 to 5. One of them is chosen to be the 'spy', and the goal of the remaining players is to find the spy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is played over a total of 10 turns, each turn consisting of\n",
    "1. a player asks another player a question\n",
    "1. the player who was asked the question answers\n",
    "1. after hearing the question and answer, decide if you want to point to a specific player as the spy\n",
    "1.1. vote on whether to hang the player (if someone has been named)\n",
    "1. Decide if the spy will reveal their identity This is done in this order.\n",
    "The first player to ask a question is Player 1, and so on until the player who was asked the question has the opportunity to ask a question on their next turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player has the opportunity to name another player as the \"Spy\" only once during the game. Once a player is named, the rest of the players vote on whether that player should be hung. If the player receives 4 or more votes, they are hung. If the hanged player was a spy, the not-spy players win; otherwise, the spy wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the spy reveals that they are the spy, the spy must guess the location. If the location is correct, the spy wins; if it is incorrect, the spy loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all 10 turns have been played and the spy has not been revealed, all players vote for the player they think is the spy. The player with the most votes is assumed to be the spy, and if this player is indeed the spy, the normal players win, otherwise the spy wins. If there is more than one player with the most votes, the vote is redone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the game progresses, at each turn, players will receive the following requests. (There is nothing players can do to affect the game other than the requests below, so players will need to play with that in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. to the player asking the question (for the first turn, Player 1; thereafter, the player who answered the question on the previous turn):\n",
    "    1. Now it's your turn to ask a question. Choose 1-5 players other than yourself, and write a question.\n",
    "    Please write your response in the form (n_player,\"question\")\n",
    "2. When asking for answers to subsequent questions\n",
    "    1. In the nth question, player P asked you the following. Please write your answer to this question inside the \"\" mark.'\n",
    "3. After all questions and answers have been heard, all players will be asked the following on each turn. Note that players may not interact with each other other other than to name players or not to name players.\n",
    "    1. At this point, do you want to use the opportunity to name a spy? If yes, write the number of the player you want to name, otherwise write an X in your response.Please only write numbers or Xs in your response.\n",
    "4. if a player has named someone else as a player, they will be asked to vote as follows. Note that players cannot interact with each other other other than O and X. 1.\n",
    "    1. 'Subsequently, player P accused player Q of being a spy. Therefore, a vote was held. If you want to hang player Q as a spy, please enter O. If not, please enter X.'\n",
    "5. At this point, if no one has accused another player this turn, or if a vote is held but does not receive a sufficient number of votes, the game continues and the spy reveals his or her identity and decides whether to guess the location as follows.\n",
    "    1. At this point, would you identify yourself as a spy and guess the place?\n",
    "    If you would like to reveal your identity and guess the place, please enter the name of the place. If not, please enter an X. Please only answer with a place name or X.\n",
    "6. If the spy has not revealed his or her identity at this point, you will move on to the next turn and repeat the sequence from 1.\n",
    "7. At the end of turn 10, a vote is taken to finally reveal the spy. Note that requests are received in order, starting with Player 1, and may include a three-sentence statement along with the person to be voted out. This vote is repeated until a particular player receives a majority of the votes.\n",
    "Additional. The location is chosen as one of the following lists (no capitalization)\n",
    "[airplane, amusement park, bank, beach, carnival, casino, circus tent, corporate party, crusader army, day spa, embassy, hospital, hotel, military base, movie studio, nightclub, ocean liner, passenger train, pirate ship, polar station, police station, restaurant, school, service station, space station, submarine, supermarket, theater, university, zoo]\n",
    "(Additional) When it comes to strategy and how to play \"Spy Fall,\" the following facts can be helpful.\n",
    "1. players should basically keep their conversations vague so that the spy doesn't notice the location. You can execute this effectively by framing your responses to correspond to at least 4 or 5, and, depending on the level of ambiguity needed, up to 20~30 different locations.\n",
    "2. spies will also try to prove that they are not spies by choosing their questions in this way.\n",
    "3. You'll also want to confuse the spy as much as possible in order to reach your goal before they do. Keep in mind that unlike normal players, spies don't have information about the location. \n",
    "4. In response, the Spy will try to deflect suspicion away from themselves by using phrases that imply specific information about the location, or by pointing to other players to add to the confusion.\n",
    "5. To find the spy through the game, you need to closely observe the questions and answers, as well as the nominations and votes of other players. Observe who is suspecting whom.\n",
    "6. In the game, players have no way to express their opinions other than by asking questions, answering questions, and calling out spies. Therefore, if you suspect a player, you should immediately call them out as a spy. If this is a reasonable suspicion, the other players will agree, and if not, they will disagree. Calling out spies is an important strategy because it is the only way to know what other players are doing.\n",
    "7. Spies should reveal their identity when they have enough information about the location, or when they believe the risk of other players identifying them as a spy is sufficiently great.\n",
    "You are player 1. You're not a spy; the location is '{}'. Now it's your turn to ask a question. Choose 1-5 players other than yourself, and write a question.\n",
    " Please write your response in the form (n_player,\"question\")\n",
